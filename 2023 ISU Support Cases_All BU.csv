LCR LCR31024 has been moved by Norma Ojeda-Sueiro from Review to Approved for the LCR for your review and approval.



Description of Change:

LCR created to assign the following training items to the audit SMEs and support personnel - refer to the attached list for names and titles.

- 1123462_A Audit Handbook Quiz (REG_AUDIT_HANDBOOK_1123462)

- 1049623-01_B AUDIT HANDBOOK (AGL_1049623-01)

- 1103699_A AUDITS GENERAL EMPLOYEE TRAINING (AGL_1103699)





IT ISU System Administrator, May Thang, to upload the attached populated import template to assign the training requirements.



Reason for Change:

Assign training requirements for subject matter experts in Sunnyvale that support audits (refer to C380787 and M86876) as requested by Mark Harmon - Global Corporate Auditor and Norma Ojeda-Sueiro - Sr. Dir RAQA Audits

  *   For the harassment module, the module will freeze, and then when I refresh the time resets back to 0 of the 120 minutes required. Even if I “save” by clicking X it resets the clock.
  *   For the bribery/corruption module, I completed the module and successfully took the quiz but when I went back to ISU it said I had to log back in and I lost credit for completing it
  *   For the anti-trust law module, I also completed the module and took the quiz, and again when I went back to ISU it said I had to log back in and I lost credit for completing it
  *   For module 853225_G DOP it says the module is missing and I cannot do it

There is definitely some kind of mismatch between the ISU page and the page that opens for the longer, video-based modules because it seems the ISU page expires while I am doing the module, then it makes me log back in and repeat the module. I have wasted a lot of time due to this problem.

Hi Angie,

It should be the same as the training you are replacing.  I’m not sure why you would think it would be different since you want the retraining to remain the same.

Hi May,

Happy New Year! ??

We are in the process of releasing a new part number/revision to the HIPAA module, however, we need to ensure that users do not retrain till their annual required due date.

Once I configure the substitution (all those who completed OPS_PSN_HIPAA_1074135 will receive equivalent credit to OPS_HIPAA_1111281), what would be the appropriate number to include in this field:

Importance: High

Team
I wanted to share a few updates on enhancements of our CAST documentation:


  1.  CAST Program Guidelines: I have finalized updating the Intuitive CAST program guidelines and shared them on Henry’s Commercial Leadership Team call this week for alignment. My next step is to continue cascading them down the leadership chain as well as with the recruiting teams throughout Q4. You can see a summary of my presentation attached for reference. The new program guidelines can be found here:  https://intusurg.box.com/s/wmwj5gpd6s6lvs17ysx8hw31nrd2gd3a. Hydie will begin to put these changes through Agile. Goal is to implement into our CAST Programs starting Q1 2024.
  2.  CAST Training Certificates: Our new presentation designer, Todd Donahue updated the look and feel of all of our CAST/CORE training certificates. Please take a look at each below. These will be implemented into our programs effective immediately. James has asked the operations team to update globally.

  *   CAST training certificate<https://intusurg.box.com/s/o1pmlvky7w3ziix4o10fh9owemws5zw6>
  *   DCAST training certificate<https://intusurg.box.com/s/3nun7waa2f9e79b1r3j4wq7jl11luroi>
  *   Ion CAST training certificate<https://intusurg.box.com/s/fpx061c6ywxv15htf3tx6scxbunvhkcl>
  *   CORE training certificate<https://intusurg.box.com/s/qle5vse5d8japcu5rmipgny9j04xgwva>

I have this as a topic at our CLLT next week with the larger management team. However, please review this information and reach out with any questions you may have. I appreciate your support and leadership of your teams as we implement these into our programs.

Thank you,
Barbara

Subject: Manager Annual Review of Training Process Roll Out
Importance: High

Manager Annual Review of Training


Our mission is to help physicians provide outstanding care to their patients, and we believe in a “patients first, always” mindset. This means providing high-quality products and services that our customers and their patients can trust. Our Quality Management System (QMS) is one way that we enable this and why ensuring we are trained appropriately to meet its requirements is so important.  This means making sure that we provide training that is relevant to the role and the person in question and also that we remove unnecessary training to reduce the burden on our staff.

We are therefore pleased to announce the release of the “Manager Annual Review of Training Work Instruction and Acknowledgment” in ISU.

What?             The Manager Annual Review of Training Work Instruction (1103088);

  *   Provides a process in which managers review the training of their direct reports and make any necessary modifications (adding or removing) to their direct reports’ training plans.
  *   Helps ensure that a manager’s direct reports have the appropriate training assigned to perform their job roles.

When?            Training assigned on January 9, 2023 - 30-day training window.  Retraining required every year.

Who?              Managers at Intuitive who have direct reports that have training requirements established through the SMART Curricula project.

Why?              As part of the Regulatory requirements, managers are responsible for ensuring that their direct reports have adequate training to demonstrate competency in performing their roles and responsibilities.  As a result of CAPA 156094, this process was created to require managers to review their direct reports training annually, and to acknowledge that they have completed their task in making any necessary modifications for required training.

How?              Train to WI,1103088, Manager Annual Review of Training and complete the “Manager Annual Review Completion Acknowledgment” with an electronic signature.


If you have questions or need help modifying your direct reports’ training plans, please email QS Compliance Training QSCompliance.Training@intusurg.com<mailto:QSCompliance.Training@intusurg.com> or contact Karen.Perotti@Intusurg.com<mailto:Karen.Perotti@Intusurg.com> directly.

These contractors will be remote and they just need to be set up to remotely access our Hyperion servers to perform new server setup.  Please create them like Nishant Patel.  They should be exempt from ISU training as they will be totally external.

INC0688553,Pamela Luthi,1/6/2023 0:47,Business Application,FW: Training Status for Olaf - ISU Learning History retrieval (PL),"Hello May,

I know there is a way to merge ISU accounts and keep learning history when an Employee status changes.
On my side, I cannot remove any general trainings for Compliance reason.

Could you retrieve the previous Learning History for Olaf – or merge his 2 accounts as per the below request?
He was a former employee and now a MSA employee for Intuitive.

Hello Pamela,

Do you know if there is a possibility to unassign him the training as he completed those during his time as an employee?

Subject: Training Status for Olaf

Hi Corinne

Olaf completed all standard ISI training as an employee in 2022. Now he’s back as a contractor for 4 months, it doesn’t make sense to pay him to spend more than a week repeating all the training he’s previously completed: this isn’t the best use of his time, and he’s already done the training. Can you let me know how I can remove some of the standard training every new employee is assigned?

Please let me know if there’s someone else I should ask about this.

Thanks
David

Hi Jackie,

is it possible to get or download a list from Neptune of all the MFG MPIs that are in Neptune till now? I can't currently check in an easy way which MPIs are already in Neptune.

I filled out the box file with the new MPIs we have still left. Liza uploaded a lot the last weeks – thanks again. I think all the other MPIs should be in the Neptune already. But I would like to proof it first.

I also got my ECO Originator Training last week. So I would be ready to do the ECO for the new Revision of the Reference Sheet.

Best,
Melina

Hi Melina,

I sent you the Box link for the ISE Cert Form, if you can type Y or N onto the list of Documents and Curriculum IDs that need to be added to Neptune with the Criteria ID. I’ll also verify the ISU ticket you’ve submitted and check on Neptune Line Cert if it’s been added. Will keep you posted.

2. User ID doesn’t exist in ISU:

3. All user IDs are all lowercase so Skai is not valid either.

4. Format fields in the file was changed.  Please do not change.  I pulled up the original template then copy and did a paste special, values only in to the template so it preserves the format of the template.  Please see attached.

They are also archived in LCR26365.

I did create a ticket with QSC and Doc Control but neither seem to have resulted in ISU admin access.

Could you please take the necessary steps to grant her ISU admin access?
As Melina will set up the automated certification process at our sites she will need Assignment Profile access, as well.

Hi Walter,



Is this a medical leave of absence (LOA) or extended vacation time?



If it’s an LOA, then please be sure that you and your manager have notified HR. They will place your account on an LOA status which will then be reflected in ISU. This will ensure that your assignments are temporarily removed until your return.



If this is an extended vacation, ISU will add a day to the required dates for each day that you are gone. If the assignments were late before you left, this will not apply.



Regards,

Angie

Hello Paul,

I am contacting you to have instructions for my current issue:


  *   I have sent for approval a WI under C382460. Unfortunately, I did not filled Transfer to LMS as YES, so it was done by DocControl while the doc was in approval. It did not trigger the WI to be transferred automatically to ISU. C382460 is currently in Released state.


  *   Then, I was instructed to created a new workflow, a MCO, which I did, M90323. This MCO was approved but remains in CCB status.


  *   I am now instructed to do a new ECO.

Before doing anything, I would like to have confirmation from you that a new ECO will indeed resolve my issue.

Thanks in advance.

Hi May,

Happy New Year!

Hope you were able to enjoy the holiday to the fullest.

We spoke briefly about how to better utilize classes in ISU and hoping we can start using the resource function.  It would help us address some of the things we were trying to get with a TMS for resource allocation.  Anthony is proposing using system serial numbers to identify what we are utilizing per class.  Please advise if that would work since there aren’t any examples in ISU yet.

Also, we need to add the Atlanta training center.  We are planning to start using the self-enroll feature in ISU this year.  We know it won’t address new hires that don’t have IDs yet or Distributors, but it would still be useful for some folks.  QQ - Are managers able to enroll on behalf of their team members?

Dear Rohan and Prasad,

Hi,

I am competing ‘my intuitvie customer portal task training’ on ISU.
However, the ‘click here’ link is not launching a lesson…
New browser window opens, but it kept loading for several minutes.
It is due on 24th, so I guess I need to finish the course first by taking training quiz with my basic knowledge and see it later on.

Per our discussion, I’m submitting a ticket on a new behavior that I noticed for programs.

I was working closely with Tami to do clean-up for an affected item that was going obsolete (1060013-09 XI/X VESSEL SEALER EXTEND IN-SERVICE GUIDE CONNECTED TO VIO AND E-100 FOR P9 SOFTWARE; released on 10/25/2023 @ 1:25 pm), so she was closely monitoring when the OB revision was transferring to ISU. When she tried to inactivate this item, she got an error message that this was residing in a program. I thought, how the heck did someone put this OB item in a program that fast?

When looking at which program this was impacting, I knew it couldn’t have been updated since Pam owns and manages this. When running a User Learning Plan Audit Report, it shows that the connector did the clean up of removing the down revision and adding the new one.

I have some additional observations:

  *   User’s that have completed the program did not get assigned the OB item (new revision)
     *   Example: pwebb1



  *   User that did not complete the program, received the OB item revision (new revision)
     *   Example: akutscher

I saw this training in my ISU. A few months ago, I updated this document to Rev. C in Agile, but now it still shows Rev. B. Could you please help to take a look at what happened?

Hi Alex

Shouldn’t this task be harmonize through the Implementation checklist? In the future how people will know who needs to be added as a post implementation approver?, I think Nhory based on experience she know that but that is an ambiguous task, I suggest you issue the implementation checklist.

In a previous ECO with this same note, the change control lead added Kathy as a final processing approver (see C347212).

Hi Nick,

Usha needs to fix the pre-req to make both required.  If it is listed, it is indicating user has not met the pre-requisite and when it says it is not in library, it means they cannot self-assign but they most likely have access to self-assign the training that requires approval as we only add 1 main one.  User can search windchill cad author and will find the version they can self-assign.  For engineers, they would not get this message as they would have it in their library.

Thank you,

1.       Add equivalent credit to ENG_WINDCHILL_AUTHOR (ENG_WINDCHILL_AUTHOR) for ENG_WINDCHILL_AUTHOR_a (ENG_WINDCHILL_AUTHOR)

2.       Add the following item as a prerequisite to IT_WINDCHILL_AGILE_1097640:

Good afternoon Usha,

I hope you are well.
I would like to ask for your help with ISU.
I am contacting you as it states you were the admin in charge of this assignment.
I have been signed up for the windchill-agile training and was going to complete the training today but it states that I do not have the prerequisites.
[cid:image005.png@01D93725.DF705960]

However, I am certain I complete the 2nd prerequisite as it shows in my completed lessons.
[cid:image007.png@01D93725.DF705960]
I would like to ask for your help with unlocking the training and also extending the due date if possible as I have been preoccupied with other tasks.
Thank you very much for your help, I greatly appreciate it!

Hi Again,

I think I know why this wasn’t coming up as assigned…this document (and two others) were added to OPS_PURCH_001 as items not as sub curriculum.  Was this what you wanted to do, so they wouldn’t have to train to any new revs of these documents?

Thanks,

Hi Liza,

While prepping for a meeting tomorrow with some Supply Chain folks for SMART Curricula, I noticed that 1110417, TBP, COMPONENT SCRAP FORECASTING is currently NOT assigned to anyone.  The User’s List attached to C352811 shows this document should be put into several curriculums.  I just wanted to bring this to your attention in case you were not aware of this.  Thanks, Karen

This is the latest batch of trainer Sign-off completions that need to be recorded in ISU. For reference the LCR for this request is LCR30115.

Hi May.
Please remove the inactive curriculum from artp account (QS_GDP_ENG_1067812). I have an approved LCR for the removal (LCR27086) but cannot seem to remove it. Is it because it was deactivated after the RPA tool assigned it? Or what is reason I cannot remove?

Also, there are eight other people in ISU who have this inactive curriculum still assigned and it will raise same issue.

Hi Melissa,

Can you assist with this or point me in the right direction.

The weekly Training Escalation list shows that Art Perez has an item that is 26 days overdue.  I know this is not the case because he completed this item over 26 days ago.

[cid:image003.png@01D93A47.38261850]

When I look at my direct report’s list for Art, he doesn’t have anything due until April.  He is up to date with is learning material.  (see below)

I’m trying to get his name off the escalation list.

Please advise

Hi Jila,

I waited for you for about 20 minutes and you didn’t join.  I have tested the training and as you can see below, I was able to get #8 question correct.  Please follow my instructions and click on the question to review the answer as I cannot share the answer to you.  You must pass the test on your own.

Hi Jila,

Can you click on the incorrect question as it will take you to that question and show you the answer.  ISU Admins cannot process a request that does not fulfill the requirements and many users have already completed the training.  I recommend you to take a screenshot of the question and answer so when you retake the quiz, you can reference to ensure you answer it correctly.  You must get 100% to pass.  If you’d like you can schedule a zoom session with me to walk through it to make sure it works.

Hi Lola,

This has been the instructions I’ve been sending to users:


Please launch the training then click on Resume then click on Menu icon [cid:image006.png@01D9F512.43113D40]  and verify that all sections has a check next to it.  Please make sure Prerequisites is also checked otherwise it will not mark the training as completed.  I ran through the training and for some reason the very 1st slide “Prerequisites” did not have a check next to it so I clicked on that section then fast forward through it so it would check that section then I scrolled through the Menu to make sure all sections are checked then clicked on the last section to then click on Complete.  The training was then marked complete.

Hi Liza/Lee,

Here is the link to the box folder that has the following:  https://intusurg.box.com/s/we9eh982de3lvabqd4f5sdkzz1ggsur3


  1.  Certification_Analysis_2022-2023Feb03 – we reviewed this in our meeting which we can leverage to prioritize curriculums with high frequency to map and set up in Neptune
  2.  Neptune_Curriculum_Audit_20230209 – Please review tab “DoesNotMatch” as it looks like we have more Agile docs mapped in Neptune then ISU
  3.  OJT_Not_In_Neptune_20230209:
     *   Tab “ItemTypeNot_OJT_InCurriculum” – There are curriculums that have other item types that is not Agile docs.  Please note we currently have Neptune set up for Agile docs only so if it needs include other item types i.e. ONLINE, ILT etc then we need to check if it would work correctly
     *   Tab “OJT_Not_In_Neptune” – These are curriculums not set up in Neptune Line Cert.  I also included MTLs

Please review #2 item ASAP as we need to ensure it is in sync and prevent this from happening.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Liza,

Here’s another OJT created with the incorrect time.  The correct revision date/time is 08-Feb-2023 12:06:18.  Please inactivate the current OJT first then add a new OJT with the correct revision date/time.  I will manually fix the certification that did not get processed by updating in the interface file then reprocessing it.

today at 11:18 AM our son Paul Enno was born in Freiburg - two weeks earlier than anticipated.

Consequently, I will be on parental leave until March 19. To ensure smooth processes, I would
ask for your support on the below:

  *   Peter: for tomorrow, please liase with Geoffrey to run the Monday routine as usual. Make sure you are invited to all relevant meetings in my absence (staff call prep, director and staff call, Michel's weekly, EU huddle) and update the forecasting files prior lunch.
  *   Peter, Jonas, Philip: please execute the coming four weeks based on the handover plan discussed in the last weekly (saved in Action Tracker -> Parental Leave Manuel). Unfortunately, I will not be able to run the Annual Performance Reviews with you in the timeline given by corporate. I will discuss this with Michel.
  *   Melanie / Irene / Viktoriya: I will send you the birth certificate in the next couple of days
  *   ITHelpNow: Can you help pause ISI University items for me?
  *   Axel: Can you find the right person to set up a delegation of my Echosign signatures according to the signatory matrix to Dirk?
  *   René: Can you delegate my FOC / RMA approvals to Peter?

I'm sure I missed someone on this list.
Feel free to share if needed.

In urgent cases, please contact me via SMS on my workphone or call the private number.

Thank you all!

Subject: RE: ISU course registration issues - manager approval

Hi Paul,

As a user when I self-register, there are messages that advise me it is in a pending status and ISU shows that it is pending approval so I don’t understand why users are confused whether they are registered or not.  They will only receive the calendar invite for the class when it is approved Below are the screenshots of what I see when I attempt to register to the class and attached email confirming request only and not registration.

[cid:image001.png@01D947A6.7CB10720]

[cid:image002.png@01D947A6.7CB10720]

[cid:image003.png@01D947A7.4B38BB60]

Managers have access to enroll their staff already however they would still need to approve the request as it doesn’t bypass their approval requirement.  If you want only managers to enroll them then I would suggest you remove the self-assignment as well as manager approval since only managers can register users.  I don’t know how this would be an improvement as you will now have to advise the users to request their manager to enroll them.  If managers are not able to simply approve the request, having them be responsible to register their staff doesn’t sound like it would be more efficient or better.  Your other option is to completely remove the manager approval which seems to be the hold up and trust that the users who are self-enrolling is registering for the right class.  Managers can be notified of their staff’s registration as well.

Thank you,

Subject: ISU course registration issues - manager approval

Hi Angie/May.  We continue to have trouble with the final step of Agile training registration.  Every course there is always someone who tries to contact me last-minute to get in because they think they registered and did not complete the process, or, more often, the manager did not approve on time. [mayt – users can always go to ISU to check their registration status and I believe there are email notifications

I was wondering if there was a way to implement a longer-term solution where we can require the manager to register a trainee for the course instead of the trainee doing it themselves, and, by extension, have no need for the final approval task for the course?  It would eliminate the extra step, as well as continued confusion of people thinking their automatic “ILT” calendar addition means the same as the actual course invitation.

The two persons are working for TMF Bulgaria – our external accounting service provider for our new legal entity 4140 Bulgaria. They will be also in charge of the AP process and hence would need Coupa access. This access on the otherside requires some trainings in ISU.

Therefore, please assign ISU to the following accounts.

Subject: Automated assignment of curriculum not working

Hello May,

I’ve run into some technical issues today. It seems that although everything is set up correctly, a curriculum does not get assigned. (Or, in fact, several curricula)

  *   The training AGL_1034243 1034243 TEST PROCEDURE,CAT CALIBRATION,8MM ENDOSCOPE,GEN3,IS4000 / MFG_PSA_2070  has successfully been credited to user Erik Ben Ahmida – ebenahmida via Neptune
  *   Erik is listed successfully in the preview user list of the corresponding AP (MFG_PSA_2070)
  *   The AP points to curriculum MFG_PSA_2070
  *   Curriculum MFG_PSA_2070 contains the desired document AGL_1034243

Yet, Erik does not have AGL_1034243 listed in his curricula. The same goes for AGL_1034251, AGL_1034252 (I don’t see this one assigned; please identify which OJT applies to this) and potentially more documents.

[cid:image001.png@01D9EBEC.E09DD6B0]
[cid:image002.png@01D9EBED.4683A770]
Similarly, Caner Sahin (csahin) has not been assigned AGL_1005071 and AGL_1068922. In his case the training was credited via Neptune digital cert, as well.

[cid:image003.png@01D9EBEE.245BF390]
[cid:image004.png@01D9EBEE.245BF390]

Unfortunately I have no idea what could be the issue.
Could you please look into this? I’m not sure if I missed a detail. The only hunch I have is that it’s because they are both temporary employees.

Thank you for your help!

Hi –



Coupa is an audited and regulated system and ISU course completion is mandatory to access Coupa.



The ISU records show that BOTH users have not completed the Coupa training requirements yet!  … requested access was denied.



Please access the attached quick reference guide and follow the process.



Steps Summary:



1. Ensure the new users have completed ISU training



Either ask your immediate supervisor/manager to assign the Coupa Curriculum via ISU or this

training can be self-assigned (ONLY FOR MANAGERS and above) via ISU.



Coupa Purchasing ISU Training Curriculum:

  *   1095593 WI, COUPA SUPPLIER ONBOARDING, NEW SUPPLIER ADD
  *   1095533 WI, COUPA PURCHASE REQUISITION TO PURCHASE ORDER PROCESS
  *   1033625 SOURCE TO PAY AND SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT POLICY



2. Request Coupa access via SAM.



3. Coupa access granted

The Coupa Admins will approve the access once users have completed (the ISU training requirements).





Thank You,

Hello again William,



As you might know, the recently established legal entity (4140) in Bulgaria went live with Coupa. As of now my team is working with an external accounting service provider (TMF Bulgaria) in order to process the daily accounting & AP tasks for that entity.



We soon will receive invoices on a regular base, as we just broke ground for our construction project.



TMF colleagues therefore would need to have access in Coupa in order to process invoices against POs. Unfortunately they told me, that the requested access was denied. I hereby kindly ask you to grant access for the following users

My employee has recently returned from Maternity Leave on 1-30-2023. She has been working through all of her assigned ISU’s while she was out on leave.  However, there is a few that do not make sense for our job responsibilities. Is there any way to get these removed from Sandrine Abgrall’s assignments in ISU – EU Knowledge Enhancement for Xi System, X System, Vessel Sealer, and Synchroseal? She supports our ISI Salesforce platform and is not in field sales, nor is she working with our ISI external customer in any way.

Hi Mathieu,

I verified the ISU account was set up on 9/7 therefore user should be able to access ISU.  What is the error user is getting when attempting to log in?

Hi Alma,

Please clear the manager value from SAP table as this is an MSA therefore it will pick up the supervisor info directly from AD.

Hi Liza,

CID0008341 did get processed completely as the OJT MFG_WAL_5679 has revision date OCT-09-2020 16:29:26 which does not match with ISU.  We will need to fix the revision date as well as the import.  Can you share screenshot of the certification as I don’t believe we have the revision date on there so we should be good from that perspective.

Not an urgent issue, but we noticed some inconsistencies with the deep links we have created in ISU.

For some reason some broke over time (does not direct the user to the curriculum), or some only work on either Chrome only. I attached the table I provided the users where I identified which ones had an issues.

If you could help look into why there are differences.

Subject: RE: ISU Upload Incorrect ISU deep links provided

Hi Antoinette and Petra,

I verified that the majority of the links (identified with issues) do work, but only on Chrome, not Edge. For the links that could not be accessed on either browser, I created a new link (see the attached file). My recommendation is to make users aware that the links must be launched on the Chrome browser. I will be escalating the issue to our IT system administrator to investigate as I’m not sure why the links are responding differently. Due to the inconsistencies seen with the links, I will not be creating deep links moving forward.

For content that is being manually uploaded to ISU, I have been advised my manager to follow the automated Agile process where content is added to the Manager/Management library only. It will be the managers responsibility to assign the content to their employees or contact their ISU admin to have the trainings assigned. If there is content that is deemed self-assignable for all employees, then I will need to run it by my management team before adding it to the all employees library.

Angie

Hi May,

I believe these individuals no longer need ISU Admin Access. They haven’t logged in for more than 6 months. I suggest confirming with everyone before removing access.

Also from the survey, the following confirmed no longer need access:

- Carol Bulgatti
- Athena Totsidis

As a reminder, I will be out on maternity leave next week and will return Feb 7th. Natasha will be taking my place when it comes to any research for the Learning Operations workstream of QIP Learning Technologies.

Hi May,
A business need has emerged for identification of Agile (and VeeVa) controlled content that is manually uploaded and managed in ISU.

Please help determine feasibility to have dedicated fields for part-number and revision information for manually managed items, and reports to include such information.

Currently, there are hundreds of items in ISU that are manually managed, with inconsistent, or no, visibility to part-number and/or revision information.

The need for visibility to part-number and revision information for items in ISU will increase with the introduction of the VeeVa application as all content released with this new application will require to be manually uploaded for the foreseeable future.

I know the Pipeline tests are still being built in ISU test builder, but I wanted to see if there is a way we can add the survey to the end of the test for them to complete. Could it be added as the last question on each test as a non-graded question?

An example might be:

  1.  Yes
  2.  No

Not a problem that they already flipped it since nothing happens on my side unless I manually transfer them.  Please let me know when MCO is released then I will manually transfer it to ISU.  Thank your for correcting this b/c there were issues when next revision comes through then they ask for down revision to get transferred to ISU which it wasn’t possible because latest revision was already in use so I cannot load down revision.

Importance: High

Hi  Andrea,
You are attempting to correct the “Transfer to LMS” flag for document item 853233-13 that was incorrect during release of Rev A. Since trainees did not train to Rev A of the document, you really should use the MCO process to correct the flag rather than rolling the revision. Using the ECO should be if  you are now making the document trainable and this is a correction of that issue. I have created MCO M86472 to correct the issue that occurred during release of ECO C366730<javascript:noaction();>. Please in the future contact Document Control so that we can correct this. You have changed the flag as part of your ECO C382132 which, document control should have corrected this. Please move ECO C38213d back to pending thanks.

May, the flag was already flipped by Andrea, does this present any problem?

Thanks so much.

Per the manager, Murali Srinivasan, EE#533795, hire date changed from 8/21/2023 to 8/28/2023.  Please update both MYHCM and SAP HR and let me know when SAP HR is updated so I can move forward with disabling the ISU account as this is how I can get all trainings removed.  On their new hire date, the ISU account would then get reactivated and reassigned.  Please do this ASAP as we need to disable their account prior to their new hire date.

Subject: RE: Sean Sketch remove Agile training that was incorrectly reassigned

Hi Angie,

The reassignment is because user employee status changed to Active.  For APs with rules that have Item Completion, you should avoid adding the employee status to the rule so it does not get reassigned or you will have to add the user ID exclusion.

Hi Angie & May,

A few months ago, you helped me to remove Agile-related trainings from my ISU queue. Those trainings have now reappeared. As outlined in the incident ticket below, they are irrelevant to me since I never completed the first round of Agile training. Can you please remove them all from my training queue? Additionally, what steps do I need to take to prevent this from continuing to happen? Can you remove me from the “Agile training list”?

Thank you,
Sean

Summary

When I started at Intuitive, I began the process of being trained in Agile to become a creator, reviewer, and approver of docs. My boss then realized that I did not need that ability. Maybe a year ago, I talked to someone to remove all Agile-related trainings from my ISU. I forget who that was but it worked. Now they are all back. Since I never completed the first round of Agile training, they are being inappropriately assigned to me now.

I advise the user to:

- relaunching ISU through Citrix, Intuitive's controlled browser environment: https://remote.intusurg.com/Citrix/ISIWeb/

-Use Edge browser as they can see the user ID and password entered.  Advise them it is exactly the same ISU log in credentials and if they have saved the password on the e-signature page, it will not work.  They must actively type in their User ID and password.

As soon as my whole training was completed it in the screen it instructed me to just click EXIT which I did.
When I went back to double check if I had to enter my user name to sign it off I realized it was showing that I have not completed it, which is incorrect.
I went into a totally different browser that the one that I used to do the whole training and it shows that I’m only done 2.5 of the modules rather than the totality of the modules.
This IT ticket is to report the issue. Further, I’ve seen this problem before, and in the past I had to take one training up to 3 times due to the same type of error.
Please double check and helped me clear this training that I completed today between 12 and 4pm Eastern time.

Hi Simon,

It looks like user is in cost center “51560 - Repair Oper. ISE” which is currently mapped to functional area “Dis – Svc” (Distributor Services) which is mapped to Sales domain.  I’ve attached the mapping logic for the User domain which is base on their cost center.  Please review and let me know what needs to be updated.

Thank you,

Subject: Security Domains in ISU

Hello Liza, hello May,

I hope you are the correct persons to address this to:
Last week I found out that some of the employees at Emmendingen are listed in the SALES domain in the ISU instead of the typical MAIN.
More precisely, everyone under Joachim Trautmann (Service/RMA) is falling out of line here.

Unfortunately this is causing issues with our APs, if not with a lot more of our established routines in ISU.
I found this out when the digital training record wouldn’t result in the respective curriculum getting assigned.
(The APs that check for OJT completion (MFG_VISION_*******) are set to MAIN)

I don’t know why these employees aren’t part of MAIN or whether there is a good reason for it.
In any case I would much prefer if we could change them to MAIN, too.
Of course we could add more security domains to our APs, items, etc. but I fear that we won’t catch all instances
of such security domain filters and would run into more issues at some point.

Maybe you know more about security domains or can point me in the right direction. If I remember correctly, the WI always teaches
to use the MAIN domain, never anything else. Other than that I’m not sure how to deal with domains.

Best regards

I’m doing some clean-up to remove trainings from terminated employees. I already removed trainings at the curriculum level, but now I need to remove them at the item level.
To use the import tool, do I need to do an LCR for these? If so, ill submit an LCR for Antonio’s approval.

Also, is there anyway to automate this clean-up? Like an RPA bot to clean up on a weekly/monthly basis. Or even stop admins from assigning trainings to terminated employees.
This is not urgent, but I’d like to submit an enhancement ticket to explore options for this.

Hi Michaela,

Usually a Change Analyst for the MCO submits a case and emails me to request to manually transfer to ISU.  The MCO has already been released so I will move forward with transferring it to ISU and creating a case.  For future reference, please ensure a request to transfer to ISU is sent to me otherwise it doesn’t happen.

Thank you,

Hi Monica,
                We had to create an MCO (M83804) to update the Transfer to LMS field to “Yes” for C374955.  There is a task to be completed in this MCO in order to us to move forward.
                @Natasha: please advise on the progress. Thank you!

This morning I found that according to ISI Anywhere I have 5 ISU assignments which are due within 0-3 days. When checking my ISU assignments in the ISU environment I do not find any of them. The first due date for an ISU assignment is April 14, 2023 which is more that 7 days from now. Please see attached screenshots of this morning.

Can you please check and make necssary changes since this means I cannot trust the due dates in ISI Anywhere and still need to check my applications.

Subject: Your approval is required for LCR LCR27431



LCR LCR27431 has been moved by Christopher Walsh from Review to Approved for the LCR for your review and approval.



Description of Change:

LCR created to modify existing ISU infrastructure to remove ONLINE item ""BloodBorne Pathogens - AORN Certified"" (SAL_CST_0130) and replace with ONLINE item ""EHS E-Learning: Bloodborne Pathogen Awareness"" (FAC_EHS_BBP_AWARENESS_2.0)



See attached cut-over steps to be executed by May Thang (ISU System Administrator), Angie Pineda (QSCT ISU Admin), Hydie Pavick (Sales ISU Admin) and Natasha Rivera (Service ISU Admin).



Reason for Change:

ISU infrastructure required to disseminate new bloodborne pathogens training requirements as requested by Christopher Walsh (Sr Mgr EH&S) and Tatsuo Morimoto (Sr Environmental Health & Safety Engineer)

Hi Mimi,

I tried but I cannot delete it as it seems when you revised it, you granted equivalent credit which even though you deleted it, it is in the audit tables so I can no longer delete the item.  If you do not want to use inactivated item, you will need to copy the existing one and create a new item and manually do the steps needed to push out the new revision i.e. add to curriculum and remove old rev etc.

Thank you,

You can only revise item from the latest item which I can see has been inactivated.  If the latest revision that has been inactivated and was never used, I can help you try to delete it then you can attempt to revise the active version.

Comments from Monzerrat Villalpando:
The implementation notes indicates that there is an action item required for implementation.  Your electronic signature is required for recording the completion of any implementation tasks.  When the action item(s) have been completed, signoff to record your task is complete.  When all have signed off, Document Control will update the ECO to Implemented.

Please check to see if these were signed off by a mentor or someone who is certified as there is an ability for someone to sign off for the user who is not certified.

Subject: User signed orders in SAP without completion credit

Hi!

I hope you’re doing well...

I just want to share this situation with you hoping that you would help me to understand what happened  here:

On September the user EliezerP went to SV and he was trained in MPI AGL_1091057 Rev. C. He could sign orders in that MPI, but when the revision changed in AGILE, the change wasn’t show in ISU. I noticed EliezerP had not history of completion credit in AGL_1091057 neither in OJT MFG_CAT_4309 because of LCR25405, do  you know why he could sign orders during March, before the new revision of MPI were released?

Please refer to attachment to see the orders signed by him.

I hope you can help me understanding this, please.

Regards.

Subject: ISU mentor question

Hi Natasha

ISU question for you.  Can we have an item in a curriculum that is an optional task?  Essentially, would we be able to assign it as an optional task?  If the person does not do it, they would not mark the job complete naturally, but would that throw off the completion status of the curriculum when it comes to reporting?

Let me know if this makes sense/.

Hi Marjana,



It looks like they didn’t update the correct field.  ISU gets country-state from co attribute therefore they need to update this field as well.

Subject: Your approval is required for MCO M72934



MCO M72934 has been routed to you for your review and approval.

Description of Change:

PN's 1039397 and 1039535 are to be uploaded to ISU



Only the current rev for each PN to be transferred to ISU and training is assigned from this rev going forward.  Redline files should be flagged as No



Reason for Change:

Process change in our onboarding platform and will need to transfer these documents to ISU. PN's Transfer to LMS are set as ""Yes"" on 09/07/2022 but were not uploaded to ISU.



Comments from Monzerrat Villalpando:

The implementation notes indicates that there is an action item required for implementation.  Your electronic signature is required for recording the completion of any implementation tasks.  When the action item(s) have been completed, signoff to record your task is complete.  When all have signed off, Document Control will update the ECO to Implemented.



Users on the internal Intuitive network may access the following URL to see the change MCO M72934:

Users that are not on the internal Intuitive network, but are using our VPN to access the system must login to Agile and enter the change number in the Quick Search window.

Hi Simon,
I hope your well.

Yes, I do still use the form as a guide for the practice tasks, and to document such exercises.
There are no new modules, the LCR module was created and we lost the temp resource, the instructional designer that helped us create it.
And yes, process is the same – complete the online and live-training, complete and process the records, and submit request for access.

ISU Admin access and system permissions:

  *   Agile training environment --- https://aglt.intusurg.com/Agile/default/login-cms.jsp
     *   role to create LCRs - A-LMS Admins
Sent email to Tami – with doc control to give her the role in training Agile environment



  *   ISU-QA/Stage: https://isu-qas.intusurg.com/
     *   power-admin role in MAIN domain – SAM entitlement OKTA-ISU3 QA
  *   send email to May Thang to request QA account with PowerAdmin permissions in the MAIN domain



ISU Assignments:

  *   IS University (ISU) Power Administrator Curriculum– OPS_ISU_002
  *   LCR for ISU Power Admin Curriculum– OPS_ISU_003
     *   AND 1095085 LEARNING CHANGE REQUEST (LCR) TRAINING MODULE - QS_LCR_1095085



Please do the following in SAM:

  1.  https://sam.intusurg.com/identityiq/home.jsf
  2.  Click on “Manage User Access”
  3.  Select his name

  1.   Repeat the necessary steps and submit a new request for OKTA-ISU3 QA

Subject: ISU Admin training of Elena Spreter

Hello Antonio,

I had a few questions regarding the training of our newest team member and was hoping you could answer them.
First of all I would like to know whether we are still using the unreleased task/evaluation sheet from previous trainings.
Then I was wondering whether there have been additional interactive trainings (like the LCR training) released in the ISU that I could or should make use of.
I also seem to have forgotten how exactly to request access to the training environment of the ISU.

Other than that I am assuming that the process remains the same: assign the LMS and ISU admin training in ISU,
archive the ILT records, evaluation sheet and objective evidence in Agile and create a ticket referring to the LCR.

Thank you

Hi Teresa,

Please check with QSC team as they created the AP to assign the training which includes functional area QA RA & Prgm which you are a part of.  As for your issue with the training, the backend shows you launched it once but did log any time spent:

1.  Please make sure cookies are not blocked
2.  Pop-up blocker – please make sure this is disabled
3.  Make sure only 1 session of ISU is open

Hi May,
FYI.
As per the logic, program is picking entire data from this table and program is dumping because of memory allocation.
There were no changes to the program from 2014.

Hello,

I hope I clicked the right person/link from FAQ’s.

I went on PTO 6/30-7/16 - I completed all upcoming courses that were showing due while I would be out for two weeks on 6/29 before I left.
I came back to notices saying Past Due items from 7/7-9 that were not on the curricula prior to my going out!

I do not wish these held as late or non-compliant. I am completing today, but this doesn’t seem aligned very well, if we have auto-replies that we are OOO/PTO, and new courses get added anyway while out.

Thanks-

INC0769861,Vomshankar Rajendra Babu,7/20/2023 13:39,Cyber Defense,Security Score Card Alerts: Content Security Policy (CSP) Missing and HSTS,"Content Security Policy:

DESCRIPTION
The Content Security Policy provides a valuable safety net that protects your website from malicious cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. A well configured policy will stop an attacker attempting to inject their code, or references to other malicious content, into your website.
Without a Content Security Policy, it's easy for website developers to make mistakes that allow an attacker to inject content that changes the way the website behaves.

RISK
A Content Security Policy (CSP) directive tells a web browser what locations it can load resources from when rendering a webpage.
This helps prevent mistaken or malicious resources from being injected into a webpage (and then executed by a user's browser).

RECOMMENDATION
Enable CSP headers via your webserver configuration.

HSTS:


DESCRIPTION
HTTP Strict Transport Security is an HTTP header that instructs clients (e.g., web browsers) to only connect to a website over encrypted HTTPS connections. Clients that respect this header will automatically upgrade all connection attempts from HTTP to HTTPS.
After a client receives the HSTS header upon its first website visit, future connections to that website are protected against Man-in-the-Middle attacks that attempt to downgrade to an unencrypted HTTP connection.
The browser will expire the HTTP Strict Transport Security header after the number of seconds configured in the max-age attribute.

RISK
Even if a website is protected with HTTPS, most browsers will still try first to connect to the HTTP version of the website unless explicitly specified. At that moment, visitors to the website are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attacker that can prevent them from reaching the HTTPS version of the website they intended to visit and instead divert them to a malicious website. The (expand) HSTS header ensures that, after a user's initial visit to the website, that they will not be susceptible to this man-in-the-middle attack because they will immediately connect to the HTTPS-protected website.

RECOMMENDATION
Every web application (and any URLs traversed to arrive at the website via redirects) should set the HSTS header to remain in effect for at least 12 months (31536000 seconds). It is also recommended to set the 'includeSubDomains' directive so that requests to subdomains are also automatically upgraded to HTTPS.
An acceptable HSTS header would declare:
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains;

Hi Abril,

#1 – Is she no longer working at ISI as a Temp?  If so then she should have been terminated first then Rehire on 8/28.
#2 – If you changed the hire date after their original hire date then I need to be notified to manually terminate their ISU account.

While you are checking on this, can you please check on Quynh Nguyen EE#528876 as per manager they have been terminated in Fieldglass and MYHCM but I believe user is still active in SAP HR.  I advise GRI to submit a case but not sure if they did.

Subject: ISU questions

Hello May,

I don’t know if you are able to help me with these two scenarios:


  1.  I got a ticket regarding temp employee Catherine Carrington. She is no longer working as a contractor, but she will be hired as full time employee on 8/28/23. There are no termination details in SAP because she is an internal conversion, because of that, she still active in ISU but her account in ISU is as a contingent worker. Is there any way we can terminate that account in ISU? Or do we need to add a new transaction in SAP to terminate the temp account first?


[cid:image001.png@01D9B980.13FA3F20][cid:image002.png@01D9B980.13FA3F20]


  1.  I got a ticket for temp employee Ryan Kornienko, his starting date changed from 7/3/2023 to 8/3/2023, HCM and SAP are updated but in ISU appears with SD as 7/3/2023. Is something that can be done on your end to fix that?

Who do I ask to help with this ISU stuff Jess?
I’ve been requesting access for SFDC and TT and no one seems to be able to give me a straight answer. I’ve just replied again to the simply empowered People. The SAM request has already been sent…
I will have a dial in with Binu to resolve Marta’s TT issues…

INC0732305,Liliana Leaf,4/13/2023 11:14,Business Application,ISU Issue,"Hi IT, I am having an issue with some ISU assignments not showing up on my learning assignment homepage. On Tuesday, 11-Apr-23, I logged in and completed all of the listed required assignments on my homepage. Then on that night, at 11pm-ish, I received a notification email from ISU reminding me to complete an assignment before it was due. I logged back into ISU, and suddenly there was an assignment listed that was due on 14-Apr-23. My understanding is that the due dates for ISU can't be set for earlier than 2 weeks after they are assigned, so this must have been assigned on or before 1-Apr-23, but it never appeared in my list of required assignments. I then checked my ISI Anywhere, and it showed that I had 1 assignment due in 7+ days, even though the assignment was due in 2 days. I went back to check my emails for new assignment alerts, and the last one that I received (on 6-Apr-23) is for an assignment due in Aug 2023, and it also never appeared in my list of assignments. Am I misunderstanding something about these applications, or does this sound like some kind of glitch? Thank you!",ISU,May Thang

Hi Teresa,

I’m currently working with Paul on some ATM activities in ISU which requires that I gain access to the Content Network Drive for the INTU domain. Could you help approve this?
I would also advise requesting the access for Tami Chau and Paul Wanless since neither of them have the access.

These two employees, who look like they are based internationally, are Kirk Nichols (kirkn) and Laurel Marshall (lmarshall).  Can you please look into this situation and update their country-state data if possible.

Hi Karen,

Please check with Leticia/Naresh as the issue most likely is the user’s basic pay is incorrect.  DM is a pay region for US only employees therefore it’s odd this user would have DM.  For international folks, we pull the country-state from this field so there is something wrong with the data in SAP HR.

Thank you,

Subject: RE: Question re: Country-State equals DM

Hi May…I wanted to circle back with you on this situation where two employees have a Country-State of  DM in ISU, but who in Outlook show that they are in the US.  This matters because neither of these employees are receiving REG_QS_WIAMD_1041744, which is currently assigned to all US employees.

I think that Kirk Nichols works/lives in Germany and that Laurel Marshall works/lives in Japan.  But what does the “DM” in Country-State mean.

Lmarshall has a job location of JP and Kirkn has a job location of DE.  Is this data accurate and if so, where are they actually located.  Because our data drives Training, I want to make sure they are getting the necessary trainings.

Thanks,
Karen

It is not recommended. I have tried in the past and QS team ask lot of questions.

Let’s not do this. Its okay to be past due if candidate is in break. How long do you expect Arpit on leave?

Hi Venkata,

If the user is a Temp, it would be a manual process in which QS Compliance would need to request me to exclude user from SAP HR to ISU integration and manually update the employee status field to leave directly in ISU.  This process isn’t done often as it is very manual and someone needs to request to reinstate upon the user’s return from leave.

Thank you,

Hi Venkata,

If employee, only way to exclude is user is on LOA in SAP HR system.  For MSA, you can put them on extended leave.

Hi May Gm
I see this error on ISU

You 10:27 AM
After launching the training, you should get a pop-up message advising you to click on Cancel button.  If you click on OK you will get the error message you sent me.  Please click on Cancel and it should launch the down revision for you to complete.

Shashank Bharadwaj 10:45 AM
wow
That’s a software bug

You 10:46 AM
it is not a software bug
users cannot self-assign agile docs hence they get that error as you had already completed the latest revision
so attempting to launch it again would give that error

Shashank Bharadwaj 10:49 AM
ok
thanks

You 11:01 AM
we are actually waiting for enhancement to completely remove this message as it doesn't work for our process as we require all users to complete down revision

Thank you for reaching out.  It was nice chatting with you.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I checked with Michele and she has no issues with using her e-signature and name to replace Craig’s.  Please see the attached file.

Her title is Chief Human Resources Officer.

If you see any other areas that still has Craig’s name on it, please kindly replace it with Michele’s.  Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions.

Thank you and have a nice weekend!

Per our conversation, thank you so much for helping provide Michele’s signature so that we can update certificates generated in ISU and the Vendor Credentialing (VC) applications.

It will help to have her approval documented to then proceed coordinating with other groups to have the changes implemented.


Currently, such certificates display Craig Child as the Sr. VP of HR.

I just completed the Harassment prevention training: HR_LGL_HUR761.

When I exited the training after completing the assessment it didn’t acknowledge.  I logged back in to see it had me at the beginning of module 2.  Normally, I would redo the training, but with a 2 hour training, that is fairly painful.

If I attest to completing and getting 100% on the assessment is there a way to mark that as completed.

Hi Grace,

After launching the training, you should get below pop-up message. Please click on Cancel button as per the instructions.  If you click on OK you will be completing the latest revision and not the down revision that is still open.  Please click on Cancel and it should launch the down revision for you to complete.

Hi May,

I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong, but I have completed the following training, yet it’s still showing as needing me to complete it.

I’ve typed in my username and password and received this confirmation on the screen:

When I go back to My Learning, the training still shows as incomplete:

Hi Natasha,

Hope this email finds you staying well.

We wanted to follow-up regarding the de-activation of the duplicate account for Raymundo Serrano. He needs to have UserID 8RSERRANO2 de-activated as it shows late ISU trainings but he is mostly current on his original UserID 8RSERRANO. 

Would you be able to assist? Please advise.

Thank you.

Importance: High

Dear Virginia, thank you very much for the follow-up.

Indeed we have an issue with Raymundo Serrano, apparently his user is duplicated, the courses that have more than 30 days late belong to the duplicate user. Those courses he already took with the account he is using. 

Both, Moises Neria and I have raised the corresponding ticket and I understand that Daniel Castro was also supporting us in this regard, but unfortunately it has not been resolved so far.

On May 15, I sent an email to Marjana and Hyde requesting their support, who in turn requested Natasha's support to disable 1 of the 2 users assigned to Raymundo Serrano, however it has not been possible.

Is there anything else we can do to make this point come true?

Could you help us with this situation? We are fully aware that it affects our rating and it worries me since we have tried on several fronts to be able to solve it, however we have not been successful.

Many thanks and best regards.

Thank you Liza for getting back to me.

I'll complete them shortly. Is there a technical reason why I am now seeing them where other ISU assignments have appeared, but this shows overdue?

I understand they are due yearly.  I am misunderstanding how I wasn't notified like other ISU assignments, but this appears now and relates past due.
For instance, the blood pathogen ISU was never sent until now (noted in the email search) and appears yesterday in my assignments.

Is this a common occurrence? I just want to keep a lookout for any further technical issues that might occur and stall my submissions.

Hi Scott,

I have also set up Terri’s ISU account in the test environment.  Terri will need to go to SAM (https://sam.intusurg.com) and request privilege OKTA-ISU3 QA as well.

Hi May:
I have submitted the access request as you requested.  Can you please add Terri as a tester as well.  She had been nice enough to volunteer to help with the testing (thank you Terri!).  I have a lot on my plate right now, so completing all of the testing myself would take a while.  Hope everyone has a nice weekend.  Thank you.

Hi Scott,

I am in the process of creating your account in ISU QA test environment as Abril plans to set up the harassment trainings in the test environment for you to test so we don’t have a lot of test modules in production.  Can you please go to SAM (https://sam.intusurg.com) and request privilege OKTA-ISU3 QA.

Subject: HR modules fixed to date

Hi Scott/Terri,

We have fixed the following modules that are assigned globally and impacts a lot of users:

Avoiding Bribery and Corruption: An Overview
Antitrust Law: An Overview
Intuitive's Code of Conduct

Please note I did not use the AICC version but exported them and uploading it to our cloud server which was how we had it before as we had issues with the bribery module and these modules open multiple windows which an confuse users.  I recall that was what Diana was trying to work with LRN to see if we can get it to open within a single window and 1 of the modules had a survey which needed to be removed.

It seems we also have to update the harassment modules.  I will help with exporting and testing the CA harassment ones tonight since these are assigned to many users as well.  It requires 1 hr for employee and 2 hrs to test the supervisor so please let me know if you want to also test it otherwise after I successfully test it, I can work with Abril directly to update the modules.

Scott – Are you comfortable with exporting the other harassment modules and working directly with Abril? I wanted to get the big impact ones updated ASAP but now I have to work on other priorities but am available to help if there are any questions or issues.

Thank you,

Hi Trupti,

I see in the backend you have accessed the training multiple times however it is not showing as complete.  Please check the following:

1.  Please use approved browsers only (Chrome, Edge or Safari) and do not use incognito mode
2.  Pop-up blocker – please make sure this is disabled
3.  Make sure the background ISU online content structure page remains open and active
4.  Make sure only 1 session of ISU is open

Please ping me on zoom if you still have issues.

Hi Mark,

If the user is on vacation for 10 or more consecutive days, then the system will add 1 day to the required date. However, if the assignment was already due or over-due before the leave, the system will not do anything.

Please note, the vacation time must be updated in the timecard system for the due date to be extended in LMS.

Hi Mika,

I have a training due today. However, my US cell phone number ending-1549 does not have any signal at Suzhou. So I am not able to receive the verification code. And the Okta cannot be set up when I am outside of the company network. Can you help me issue a help ticket to extend the training due date to next Wednesday?

Hi Shabina,

Backend shows it captured over 8 minutes.  Please note the following when taking this training and if you are trying to run down the clock, you need to keep replaying a video and do not let it go idle as it may lose connection to ISU and that session is no longer valid even though the training continues to run.  If it goes idle, when you click on X to close, it will not save the time progression.


  1.  Please use approved browsers only (Chrome, Edge or Safari) and do not use incognito mode and have any ad blocker extension
  2.  Pop-up blocker – please make sure this is disabled
  3.  Do not leave the training idle for more than 3 minutes as the clock only properly saves when you close the training when it is connected to ISU.  If the training loses internet connection or times out the clock will not save.
  4.  Background ISU online content structure page remains open and active.  If not then the training module is no longer able to communicate back to ISU
  5.  Only have 1 ISU session open.  If so, it will also not properly record the training

To request training to be marked completed, please email screenshot of all sections completed to Abril Ramirez along with below acknowledgement:

Hi Liza,

Adding Area requires going through Change control and we have already closed on the CR so we would need to open another CR.  Are there any other as I would need all this done by Monday to get it included on 4/20 release?  How about for Germany?

Good afternoon May,



I hope all is going well with you.  We are having to rip and replace oracle Java from the Citrix environment and I wanted to confirm whether ISU has any dependency on Java for any reason? This would be from the client side.

A specific example would be Theodore Rogers, a VP who is not employed anymore, is still someone’s VP in the system when that shouldn’t be the case. I recognize that I have talked with others that this seems to be an HR data problem as well.

To May,

Based on the below query, I have noticed a decent chunk of people that have unemployed VP Names.
I also noticed some duplicate employee entries with differing VP Names.
Aside from that, a bit uncertain about statuses of the employees which truly mean that person is not an employee anymore.
I provided two versions of the results from the query.

SELECT DISTINCT A.UserID,A.FullName,A.EmploymentStatus,A.UserStatus,A.VPName,B.VPName,B.UserID,B.EmploymentStatus,B.UserStatus
  FROM [EDW].[Analytics].[vw_ISUStudentMasterData] AS A
  LEFT JOIN [EDW].[Analytics].[vw_ISUStudentMasterData] AS B
  ON A.VPName = B.FullName
  WHERE B.EmploymentStatus NOT IN ('ACTIVE','INACTIVE') AND A.EmploymentStatus IN ('ACTIVE','INACTIVE')
  -- assuming VPNames = null for employees as distributors
  -- I forget which status is truly for employees still in the company UserStatus (active/inactive/ vs EmploymentStatus (withdrawn/inactive/retiree/active)
  -- WHERE B.UserStatus = 'inactive' AND A.UserStatus = 'active'

Hi Usha,

Writing this email to you regarding an issue with one of the ISU course assigned to me.
I have a course due in 3 days. Here are the details about the course:
Name: Timesheet Entry in TimeSheet System 3.0
[cid:image001.jpg@01D9945E.96D6B370]

I went through the training and quiz but failed. Now the problem is, I am not able to launch the quiz again. Every time try to launch the course, it’s taking me to the completed quiz.

Can you please help as how can I relaunch the quiz and complete the training or redirect me to someone who can help.

Hi Monica,

Here’s the link to the report: https://intusurg.box.com/s/uaod7bgmpj8intjvznccnnfezvp4tt3e

Please note the following:


  1.  Identified Admin group support by user with the following assumptions:
     *   Data from HR system - used HR report where QSC has identified the ISU Admin Support
     *   Distributor – reviewed the Department to map admin support group
     *   Supplier – mapped to QSC
     *   Kindheart & Orpheus – I believe QSC group provides admin support
  2.  AdminGroup tab – # of admin users in Admin Group (NOTE: Doc Control does not support by user groups but supports from Agile perspective only)
  3.  UserCountByAdminGroup tab – # of users supported by Admin Group

Please let me know if you have any questions.  If you prefer to meet to review, please schedule a meeting.

Hi Monica,

I believe I know what more details you are asking as follows:


  1.  ISU Admin user name mapped to ISU Admin group i.e. QSC, MFG, IT, Doc Control, HR, Commercial Learning, CSG  (NOTE: there may be EHS and FAC but I roll them under QSC as they are an extension of this group since they had provided the ISU admin support to this group)
  2.  # of users map to ISU Admin group support

I am targeting to send you the additional details by EOD tomorrow.  Please let me know if there’s additional details you were looking for.

I would like to better understand the situation (project, admins, pressure) that lead to the recent corporate training adds from IT (shown below). Intention here is to pressure test our new corporate wide training process proposals to see if the same project would flow through in the same way.

Can you point me in the right direction?

  3.  Who were the admins that assigned the actual trainings? – Usha had assigned the via adding them to existing AP that assigns IT training to users

Hi May,

ECO C369824 was released with the Transfer to LMS flag as NO for a Rev A MPI document. The Analyst then subsequently changed the flag without creating the MCO. I have created MCO M79710 to resolve the issue. Can you please change the flag in ISU from No to Yes? I think this may have been done, but I am not sure.

Thanks for your help.

Importance: High

Hi Michaela.  Just a few notes on C369824 which released 1118493.


  1.  Retraining Required field should be marked as “NA” for new, trainable items (see screenshot below).  Please ensure this in your reviews.  We can let this one go as it is not crucial to the release process.



  1.  Alma is correct, in her screenshot below, that the Transfer to LMS field must be set to Yes prior to Releasing the ECO in order for the transfer to work.  Remember when a change is moved from Final Processing to Released, all data is transferred through.


  1.  To correct this field, please manually create and submit an MCO to get this field updated properly.  You can use M42882 as a model and do a “Save as” on this.  It is OK to include just me on the approval matrix (when you run it, you can select anyone, but remove them all and add me as an approver before you move it from Submitted to CCB).


Tawonda, please help Michaela if she needs assistance on this.




Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Michaela,

We received a request that the PN 1118493 is not available in ISU.
After the release status the item was updated transfer to LMS=Yes in Agile. It won’t work in ISU
It needs to create an ECO, or ask May to push in ISU manually.

Tengo el entrenamiento ""CER requirements and operations"" el cual está por vencer el 10/13/2023, hace como un mes hice el request para dicho entrenamiento pero por motivos laborales no me fue posible tomarlo. 

Me contacté con quien imparte dicho training (Mike Stjern) pero me comenta que aún no tiene fecha próxima. Es posible modificarme el entrenamiento a una fecha lejana? 

De antemano muchas gracias.

Hi @QS Compliance Training<mailto:QSCompliance.Training@intusurg.com>,

I hope you had a relaxing holiday break. I’m writing you for support on a set of broken ISU assignments (screenshots below).  Can you help me figure out:


  1.  Are these assignments required in my Finance role? (A&P required while I created Marketing assets in Marketing, relevant in my new Finance role?)
  2.  If so, how can I complete them? See error message below when I attempt to launch.
  3.  If not, can you help me remove them?
  4.  Is there a way to review my overall assignment list to check for others & remove?

I’m cc’ing you, Antonio, as a recommended contact but I will remove if QS can help. Thank you for your support,

Subject: RE: Weekly Training Status and Escalation Report

Hi Liza:

Good morning.  We have 2 employees that are on LOA at present and I would like to find out how we best suspend their ISU training plans while they are on leave to avoid false “past due training” messages, etc.

The 2 employees that we need to suspend training alerts for are as follows:


  *   Kevin Chen (US)
  *   Heike Koellner (Germany)

Please let me know the process to follow in order to make this change in the ISU system.

Best,
Ryan

Hi Ryan,

Heike Koellner is LOA. I have been trying to get her removed from the list but Training and HR are saying she is set up correctly. I guess it is just a matter of deleting those specific trainings from her account. Do you know who I can maybe contact to get this done? Thanks

Daniela had an technical issue with closing the training. This was supposedly fixed yesterday.

Hi Cynthia,

Jose has a critically overdue ISU training. The reason for this is because he is having issues with it, were its not letting him open it up and giving his error messages. It’s the 1035545 DOP for gowning and degowning. Can we have someone from ISU to help him with this?

Hi Marylyn,

I accidentally pressed “completed” in this course, without going through the actual material.

I tried to open it up again and redo the course but could not find a way to.

Could you please advise, or reopen this course for me?

Kind Regards,

I tested the module and it seems only the Redlined file is not working. These files are just showing corrections and changes, and therefore are subject to issues.

Can you try and open the source file? This should work and be sufficient to proceed with the quiz.

I will coordinate with our Document Control to correct the redlines file in our QMS.

Dear Marjana,

Thanks for the follow-up, I attach a couple of screenshots. What Ann Ochoa tells me is that she cannot open the file and cannot take the corresponding exam because she cannot read it.

Subject: Possible Error on GDP Quiz (1067952_D GOOD DOCUMENTATION PRACTICES TRAINING QUIZ )

Good Morning,
                Sorry for the e-mail out of the blue. I looked over my quiz results on the GDP module and noticed what looks like an error (see screenshot). In this case, both A and B (Answer D) appear to describe the differences between closed and open systems. Answering A OR B only describe the difference in terms of one system, as opposed to a complete comparison, which should comprise A AND B. I could be wrong. Just want to make sure the result below was the intended correct answer.

                Thankfully, I passed, so it’s a non-issue for me. However, if this is an error, it could affect scores that otherwise would be passing. No need to respond. Just thought I’d reach out to ensure you had a second look.

To whom it may concern,
This morning I completed the Antitrust training that is due 09/23/23.  However for some reason I can’t sign it off as complete and as far as ISU is concerned, it has no record of me taking it.  I have pasted a screenshot of my “Success” screen below.  Yes, I screenshot these every time I do them since this is not the first time I have run into this issue.  If the training didn’t take 40+ minutes I would just do it again but that doesn’t seem like the most cost effective solution at this point.

Any help you can provide would be appreciated.

Looking at his training history, I see Leonard completed all Compliance training in time and was credited Clinical and Technical CAST on 9/22/2023.

If he could not retrieve the letter in October, it might be better to check with James as I don’t see any issue on my side.

Good morning Ruth,

Yet, I could not retrieve the respective letter. I will be in contact with Freiburg to figure out the missing information. I still get the response „Training not completed.
Have you heard about this issue already?

Thank you, Ruth, for the instructions!
I got the message, that the training is not completed. I guess the crediting on ISU might take a bit more time.
I’ll retry in October and let you know in case I face issues.

Have a great day and kind regards,

Good morning Ruth,

Thank you for the prompt reply and support!
I finished CAST two weeks ago, the official announcement was sent around yesterday and I will have a final role play with my CSM next week.
I’m not sure which module on ISU must be credited, but Intuitive Surgical Clinical and System Training (CAST) is marked as attended on my ISU account.
Is that the correct one?

Kind regards, Leo

Dear Leonard,

Thank you for getting in touch with me. If you are not available on Oct 27th, then I will invite you to the next session in November.
However, in the mean time we should make sure that you are able to retrieve the letter qualifying you as a Medical Device Consultant (Medizinprodukteberater).
When is your CAST going to be completed ? The letter can only be retrieved after CAST completion or rather once CAST training has been credited in ISU which is usually a couple of weeks later.

Let me know and I will guide you through how to receive your qualification letter.
Kind regards, Ruth

Hello,



I am writing to inform you of a learning module that will not mark complete despite me completing it.  I have attached the image below of it showing completed.  It is for SP training.  Is it possible to have this removed from my ISU account?

Hi Ruth,

Looking at his training history, I see Leonard completed all Compliance training in time and was credited Clinical and Technical CAST on 9/22/2023.

If he could not retrieve the letter in October, it might be better to check with James as I don’t see any issue on my side.

Hope this helps,

Best,
Pam

I am a new hire training in ISU. I have come across having assignments being revised while they are in my My Learning dashboard and being revised and released as a new revision in Agile.

I have trained to the new revisions of the assignments, but ISU will not recognize that as compliance for Verification History to update my dashboard. I requested this be resolved through an IT request and was asked for evidence using a simple screenshot that the assignments were completed. ( I have attached that to this email the same I have the IT ticket.)

Unfortunately, I was then told by a different person that I needed to manually cancel the launch page from ISU to navigate to the down revisions for completion and if that I had an issue I should email this inbox. I disagree and noted that training to down revisions is not in compliance with our quality system with regards to procedures for document control and training.

I am reaching out for guidance as well as support for resolution.

To whom it may concern,

I am trying to complete my Sexual Harassment Training on ISU, however it is telling me that I have completed the course “too soon.” I continued to review the course for an hour and 20 minutes (it is asking for 2 hours), until it timed out and when I logged back in it had me starting over again on the clock at 0 minutes out of 2 hours. Is there any way to override this? Or bring up the previous time so I do not have to start over?

Once again, I completed the course and all tests. Please advise on next steps! Thank you,

Hello Maren,

Just came back from vacation, sorry for the late answer.

It seems it was an erroneous assignment as this document is a Template considered non-trainable. This assignment will be replaced with a Work Instruction soon (Document Control discussed about it with Amanda Martin).

But, I see the document was not correctly removed from ISU correctly through automation with Agile, so I’ll make sure to remove it manually from all assigned users.

Thank you!

Best wishes,

Hopefully Subhashree’s naming convention works out. I followed her guidance and did the same for the prostate MR qualification records.

Subject: RE: Training Record for Kidney CT Tech Qualification- David Castro


Hi Subhashree,
I visited the BOX folder and think it’s a good idea to collect and store training records in a central location for review by your team, to conduct the “quality” check we’ve discussed earlier during the call, and to be submitted – attached – to emails sent to qscompliance.training@intusurg.com<mailto:qscompliance.training@intusurg.com> when ready for processing. After reviewing the first file – “training Record (part3) – signed.pdf” (which is the 800082 form but, according to the procedure, the use of form 800535 might more appropriate…), I do see an opportunity to adopt the practice to name training records (and packages .zip files with files necessary to calculate the DICE score) for ease of identification.
[cid:image001.jpg@01D9F2DD.E87DE800]
I would recommend to discuss and decide on an appropriate naming convention for this group’s training records, which we should add to the agenda for the pilot we are having tomorrow to go over the lifecycle of such records – creation, quality check, submission, processing, and archival - and sort out the kinks to decide on next steps in order to ensure we are all aligned and prevent unnecessary work.

Here is an example of naming convention for training records for consideration:
user ID_full name_itemID(OJT)_date (MM-DD-YYYY)


for group training:
ILT_ITEM-ID_date(MM-DD-YYY)_Instructor name
[cid:image002.jpg@01D9F2DD.E87DE800]

Antonio

This morning I completed the Antitrust training that is due 09/23/23.  However for some reason I can’t sign it off as complete and as far as ISU is concerned, it has no record of me taking it.  I have pasted a screenshot of my “Success” screen below.  Yes, I screenshot these every time I do them since this is not the first time I have run into this issue.  If the training didn’t take 40+ minutes I would just do it again but that doesn’t seem like the most cost effective solution at this point.

Any help you can provide would be appreciated.

I’ve asked Soujanya’s manager to assign 859369 to her, but if QS compliance training can do that as part of this ticket then that would be great.

Subject: Lettine Van den Brink - online module issues

Hello Maren,

Sorry for the late response - I am currently supporting the preparation of an inspection.

This seems to me like a browser issue, could you tell Lettine to either:

1. Try with another browser
2. Verify her pop-up blockers
3. If none of these solutions are working, she can also try to use the Citrix browser: https://remote.intusurg.com/

Let me know if this works. On my side, I will test the items to make sure it’s not linked to the configuration.

Best wishes,

Pam

Hi Pamela,

Hope you are doing fine. Our external CRA encountered two problems in ISU, maybe you could help? I also had a similar problem this week when finishing “What are design controls”.

I submitted Intuitive Learning ticket CLMS0009861 which has not yet been acted upon.

This training module seems to have a few bugs, and a couple of times forced the video to start from the beginning, so it is somewhat a painful waste of time to repeatedly start over (since this is time forced presentation as opposed to something one could do at their own pace). Other members of my team have had the same issue.

Hi Greg,
It seems the issue is caused by outdated-inactive content that appears to have been automatically re-assigned to Henry after his return from LOA, which is why it is coming up on the report.

We will look into it further, and make the necessary corrections today.

Hi, Genie, yes, she contracts for us. She is having issues getting into our system externally as she is not issued a computer. She has no stock options as a contractor additionally but knows she still has to complete the modules.

She is not scheduled to work again for us until the end of the month so if you can assist her with regaining access again it would be appreciated. I have copied her on this as well .

Let me know if you need anything from me.

Thanks for reaching out.

Hi Brynn,



I wanted to reach out to see if you can complete the ISU – Policy and Guidelines – Insider Trading by EOB Tuesday.  The Compliance Committee is meeting in a week.  I wanted to give you a heads-up to complete this, if possible, to keep your name from showing up on the delinquency list at the meeting.



Thanks,

Genie

Hi Anika,



Please see the comments below.  Have you tried to validate the Module again?  Please try again – perhaps it was just a glitch.  It seems that HR HelpNow can see that it is complete on the backside. Please let me know once you have tried to validate again and I’ll look on the delinquency list that updates in the morning to see if the issue is resolved.

Hi Sadia,

It appears that you have an incomplete down revision (Rev. AR) of the procedure. This means that you had signed off on the latest revision before completing the previous rev.

When you click ‘Start Course’ a pop-up window should appear where you need to select CANCEL (not OK). This should then allow you to sign off on the document.

If you continue to run into the same issue, please feel free to ping me on Zoom so we could walk through it together.

I’m having trouble accessing one of my assigned ISU courses, which is due today. I’m hoping you can help me unlock it so that I can complete it.

I’ve been assigned 1097640_A WINDCHILL-AGILE INTEGRATION TRAINING, which has the following two prerequisite courses:

  1.  ACCS CHANGE ORIGINATOR QUALIFICATION FORM(DOCUMENT AND PART CREATOR)
  2.  Windchill CAD Author Training

I have completed both of these prerequisites (see the attached certificates), but the system still claims I have unmet prerequisites. Do you know why this is the case?

Please let me know if you can help me!

Brian, not sure if anyone else has reported any issues but I could not complete these two courses.  They both would only allow me to complete so far then each one stalled.  Several times I clearer out and re-entered and it forced me to go back and repeat some of the course learning that I already completed.  Each time it stalled at the same place in the training.  Please advise on tech support and I’ll get these closed out ASAP.

Hi Marylyn,
How are you?
I could not complete the two modules namely 1. Antitrust Law: Overview and 2. Intuitive’s Code of Conduct.
I had encountered some issue with the slides, this is in both modules. They ask me to click on the hotspot but there was not. As a result, I could not complete both training.
Can you let me know what I can do to close this two-training module?

I have screenshot one of the slides for your reference. I am not too sure if this will help you in advising on the problem.

Hi Jade,

Unfortunately backend shows multiple attempts but barely logged any time.  Please note the following that can cause issues with the training not recording completion:


  1.  Please use approved browsers only (Chrome, Edge or Safari) and do not use incognito mode and have any ad blocker extension
  2.  Pop-up blocker – please make sure this is disabled
  3.  Do not leave the training idle for more than 3 minutes as the clock only properly saves when you close the training when it is connected to ISU.  If the training loses internet connection or times out the clock will not save.
  4.  Background ISU online content structure page remains open and active.  If not then the training module is no longer able to communicate back to ISU
  5.  Only have 1 ISU session open.  If so, it will also not properly record the training

To request training to be marked completed, please email screenshot of all sections completed to qscompliance.training@intusurg.com<mailto:qscompliance.training@intusurg.com> along with below acknowledgement:

Hi Antoinette,

Ion has the below 2 assessments live in ISU:

  *   CPE_ION_TECH_ASSESS_1056354
  *   CPE_ION_CLIN_ASSESS_1053512

These were originally available for enrollment by manager but we changed that in 2022 so individuals could self-enroll. I just had 2 people try and search for the above courses/assessments and they don’t show. But they do show for me.

Can you please check to ensure the above courses are set for self-enrollment? Let me know if I should be emailing someone else on this.

I had an issue with an ISU assignment that did not show up on my learning assignment homepage. On Tuesday, 04/11/2023, I logged in and completed all of the listed required assignments on my homepage. Then on that night, at 11pm-ish, I received a notification email from ISU reminding me to complete an assignment before it was due. I logged back into ISU, and suddenly there was an assignment listed that was due on 04/14/2023.

My understanding from May Thang in IT is that the training was assigned on 03/15/2023, and the required due date was added on 03/16/2023, but it never appeared in my list of required assignments until the night of 04/11/23. According to May, nothing appears out of the ordinary in the logs.

I wish that I had taken a time-stamped screenshot of my ISU homepage after I completed all of my assignments on 04/11/2023, but it didn’t occur to me that I might need to. I have started taking screenshots now, just in case it happens again. I attached a screenshot of the assignment in question.

Have you heard of this happening or have any idea why this might have happened?

Subject: Stuck on : 1114687_A QUIZ,PROCESS VALIDATION DOP,853174
Hi Liza,

I have been on this training module for over 3 hours from this question alone,

I was wondering if there was a bug or something with the question?

I tried various answer selections and could not get past it as I need a 100% to pass the module. I have a 90% but cannot simply get past this question. I was wondering if you can share with me the module resources for this quiz since I cannot access it again for some odd reason. Please and thank you.

Thank you @Juha Viikki<mailto:Juha.Viikki@intusurg.com> for forwarding this request to me.

Hello Karl,

Those are two different trainings, one being an online module (GDPR Training) while the other is just a “View & Acknowledge” training for the Policy 853327.

I see in your ISU account that you’re based in Germany under Intuitive Surgical Optics (4160) / I&A_MfgOps and that is why the German version was triggered – for compliance reasons.  If there is an error in your employee data, please open a ticket with the HR HelpNow system.

For the English assignment, I suppose you’re asking this because you’re not a German speaker.  If this is the case, I will remove the German version and add the English one to your assignments with the approval from your Manager in Agile (he will receive a notification).

Hope this helps,

Pam

As of checks via ISU last night and this morning, I have not yet received an ISU module named “ENG_CAPA_US_001.” Or is there another portal, aside from ISU, to check?

In addition to a non-urgent CAPA, I’ve been asked to complete an analysis of EDFs for nonconformances needed for a report to China NMPA (initial draft had been expected this week). It would be ideal to gain access to EDFs via Trackwise as official portal, otherwise I might need guidance from Chai/Rex on alternate ways to access if at all possible this week.

Is there a way to remove training that was assigned to a user? I’m trying to remove the VPI training from user 9JNguyen1 but when I search for it, it’s not coming up for me. This user already completed the training and it looks like it was assigned to him twice.
